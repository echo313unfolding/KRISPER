# Marketing Posts for KRISPER

## Twitter/X Thread

```
1/ What if you could code in plain English?

No brackets.
No semicolons.
Just write what you want.

Introducing KRISPER ðŸ§¬

2/ Instead of:
function compress(file) {
  return zlib.compress(fs.readFile(file));
}

You write:
"compress file as backup"

That's it. It works.

3/ Even better - write POETRY that executes:

when morning arrives:
    emit sparkle
    grow happiness

This is real code that runs. Not a concept.

4/ Open source, MIT licensed, working today:
github.com/echo313unfolding/KRISPER

Stop learning syntax.
Start writing intent.

## Dev.to Article

Title: "I Made Programming Work in Plain English (No, Really)"

```markdown
I got tired of explaining to my mom why this:
```python
if user.age > 18:
    grant_access()
```

couldn't just be:
"if user is adult: grant access"

So I built KRISPER.

## It Actually Works

```bash
from krisper import compile_text

code = compile_text("compress data using maximum compression as small_data")
# Returns executable JSON that actually compresses
```

No magic. No AI. Just pattern matching that turns English into code.

Title: "I made a compiler that turns plain English into code (with demo)"

```
Tired of syntax? Write code like this:

    compress payload 'Hello World' using seed=42 as greeting
    compare greeting with expected

It compiles to executable IR. No LLMs, just regex and determination.

Demo: [asciinema link]
Code: github.com/echo313unfolding/KRISPER

Yes, it handles edge cases. Yes, it has tests. Yes, you can add patterns.
```

Show, don't tell!
