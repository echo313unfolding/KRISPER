# Contributing to KRISPER + Bio_Poetica

Thank you for your interest in contributing to KRISPER + Bio_Poetica! We believe programming should be as natural as thinking and as beautiful as poetry.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Natural Language Patterns
Add new ways to express programming concepts in plain English:
- New verbs and operations
- Alternative phrasings
- Domain-specific vocabularies

### 2. Bio_Poetica Poetry
Create new poetic patterns that compile to code:
- Consciousness-aware algorithms
- Nature-inspired control flow
- Whitespace encoding patterns

### 3. Language Targets
Add support for more programming languages:
- Extend the KRISPER compiler
- Add language-specific generators
- Create Bio_Poetica â†’ Language mappings

### 4. Documentation & Examples
- Tutorial poems that teach concepts
- Use case demonstrations
- Integration guides
